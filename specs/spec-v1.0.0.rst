Fuel Plugin for VMware NSXv SDN integration
===========================================

NSXv plugin for Fuel provides an ability to deploy OpenStack cluster that is
utilizing vCenter computing clusters and NSXv network virtualization
platform [1]_.

Problem description
===================

Proposed change
===============

Implement a Fuel plugin [2]_ which will deploy NSXv plugin for OpenStack networking
service (Neutron) and configure it.

Plugin assumes that end user already has vCenter with NSXv up and running.

Starting from Fuel 6.1 it is possible to deploy dual-hypervisor cloud, e.g. it
is possible to use VMware vCenter and KVM computes in single OpenStack
environment.  In OpenStack environment with NSXv plugin it will be not possible
to use KVM/QEMU compute nodes, because NSXv networking platform is not
supported by KVM hypervisor.

Plugin components will include:

- customized nova packages (python-nova)
- task for generating appropriate data for Neutron deployment
- puppet manifests for installation and configuration Neutron NSXv plugin

In Fuel 7.0 when user marks vCenter checkbox in 'Compute' step of 'Create a new
OpenStack environment' wizard it leads to inability to select Neutron in
'Networking setup' step, because in Fuel 7.0 the only available network backend
for vCenter is nova-network.

Plugin will be compatible with Fuel 7.0.


Alternatives
------------

None.

Data model impact
-----------------

Plugin will produce following array of settings into astute.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nsxv:
    nsxv_manager_ip:
      value: 172.16.0.249
    nsxv_user:
      value: admin
    nsxv_password:
      value: r00tme
    nsxv_datacenter_moid:
      value: datacenter-126
    nsxv_cluster_moid:
      value: domain-c133,domain-c134,domain-c138
    nsxv_resource_pool_id:
      value: resgroup-134
    nsxv_datastore_id:
      value: datastore-138
    nsxv_external_network:
      value: network-222
    nsxv_vdn_scope_id:
      value: vdnscope-1
    nsxv_dvs_id:
      value: dvs-141
    nsxv_backup_edge_pool:
      value: service:compact:1:2,vdr:compact:1:2

REST API impact
---------------

None.

Upgrade impact
--------------

None.

Security impact
---------------

None.

Notifications impact
--------------------

None.

Other end user impact
---------------------

Plugin settings are available via the Settings tab on Fuel web UI.

User has to extract needed settings out of vCenter and enter these settings on
the settings tab.

It does not matter at what interface end user will assign 'VM fixed' network
(aka Private network) where VM traffic flows on Controller node, because all VM
traffic including DHCP and L3 services is terminated inside vSphere
infrastructure.

User experience will be awkward with NSXv plugin, user have to select
nova-network backend when he creates new OpenStack environment in Fuel web UI.
After enabling NSXv plugin for this environment Neutron will be deployed as
network provider.  From user perspective it looks awkward.

Performance Impact
------------------

None.

Other deployer impact
---------------------

None.

Developer impact
----------------

Since it is not possible for user to select any Neutron option in 'Create a new
OpenStack environment' wizard deployment serializer would not be able to
generate network data for Neutron granular deployment tasks.  This obstacle can
be overcome with custom puppet class that will prepare nova-network
parameters for neutron manifests.  Only after that it will be possible to
utilize neutron deployment tasks from fuel-library [3]_.
