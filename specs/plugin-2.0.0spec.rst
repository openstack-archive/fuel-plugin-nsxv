==================================================
Fuel Plugin v2.0.0 for VMware NSXv SDN integration
==================================================

NSXv plugin for Fuel provides an ability to deploy OpenStack cluster that is
utilizing vCenter compute clusters and NSXv network virtualization platform.

Problem description
===================

Upcoming Neutron server manifests refactoring [0]_ breaks backward
compatibility for Fuel NSXv plugin v1.0.0. Deployment manifests of the plugin
must be adjusted according to this change.

Proposed change
===============

Plugin changes can be summarized in the following list:

 * Refactor puppet deployment manifests.

 * Fuel 8.0 will be extended with component registry feature [1]_. This will
   allow plugin implement its own option in cluster creation wizard, which will
   significantly simplify interaction with Nailgun database. Plugin will not
   need to update Nailgun database to enable Neutron networking option for
   vCenter. Plugin installation will be much faster, since we no longer need to
   wait for docker container restart.

 * Fuel 8.0 will shipped with OpenStack Liberty. Neutron NSX plugin must be
   updated to new version.

 * During OpenStack Liberty development cycle new configuration options were
   added to Neutron NSX plugin (**exclusive_router_appliance_size**,
   **edge_appliance_user**, **edge_appliance_password**, **dhcp_lease_time**,
   **locking_coordinator_url**). Plugin should provide input fields for this
   options on its page with settings.

 * Plugin must create predefined networks (*net04*, *net04_ext*) in order to
   allow end user start OSTF checks against deployed cloud.

 * Nova project merged changes required for NSX support in Liberty release.
   This means that plugin package do not need to carry customized python-nova
   package. It will be dropped.

Plugin assumes that end user already has vCenter with NSXv up and running.

In OpenStack environment with NSXv plugin it will be not possible
to use KVM/QEMU compute nodes, because NSXv networking platform is not
supported by KVM hypervisor.

Plugin will be compatible with Fuel 8.0.


Alternatives
------------

None.

Data model impact
-----------------

New values will be added into astute.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nsxv:
  ...
    nsxv_exclusive_router_appliance_size:
      value: large
      description: "Edge form factor for exclusive router"
      regex: ^(compact|large|quadlarge|xlarge)$
    nsxv_edge_appliance_user:
      value: root
      description: "User for Edge node login"
    nsxv_edge_appliance_password:
      value: p@sSw0rD+
      description: "Password for Edge node login"
    nsxv_dhcp_lease_time:
      value: 86400
      description: "DHCP lease time"
    nsxv_locking_coordinator_url:
      value: http://192.168.0.30:2181
      description: "URL for distributed locking coordinator"

REST API impact
