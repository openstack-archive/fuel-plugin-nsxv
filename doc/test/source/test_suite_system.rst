Steps
#####

    1. Deploy cluster with enabled SpoofGuard.
    2. Run OSTF.
    3. Setup spoofguard:
      * In the vSphere Web Client, navigate to Networking & Security -> SpoofGuard.
      * Click the Add icon.
      * Type a name for the policy.
      * Select Enabled or Disabled to indicate whether the policy is enabled.
      * For Operation Mode, select Automatically Trust IP Assignments on Their First Use
      * Click Allow local address as valid address in this namespace to allow local IP addresses in your setup.
        When you power on a virtual machine and it is unable to connect to the DHCP server, a local IP address
        is assigned to it. This local IP address is considered valid only if the SpoofGuard mode is set to
        Allow local address as valid address in this namespace. Otherwise, the local IP address is ignored.
      * Click Next.
      * To specify the scope for the policy, click Add and select the networks, distributed port groups, or
        logical switches that this policy should apply to.
        A port group or logical switch can belong to only one SpoofGuard policy.
      * Click OK and then click Finish.

nsxv_disable_hosts


Description
###########

Check instance creation on enabled cluster.


Complexity
##########

core


Steps
#####

            1. Setup cluster with 3 controllers and cinder-vmware +
               compute-vmware role.
            2. Assign instances in each az.
            3. Disable one of compute host with vCenter cluster
               (Admin -> Hypervisors).
            4. Create several instances in vcenter az.
            5. Check that instances were created on enabled compute host
               (vcenter cluster).
            6. Disable second compute host with vCenter cluster and enable
               first one.
            7. Create several instances in vcenter az.
            8. Check that instances were created on enabled compute host
               (vcenter cluster).


Expected result

Steps
#####

            1. Upload the plugin to master node.
            2. Create cluster and configure NSXv for that cluster.
            3. Provision three controller node.
            4. Deploy cluster with plugin.
            5. Get configured clusters morefid from neutron config.
            6. Add node with compute-vmware role.
            7. Redeploy cluster with new node.
            8. Get new configured clusters morefid from neutron config.
            9. Check new cluster added in neutron config.


Expected result
###############

Clusters are reconfigured after compute-vmware has been added.
